1. Introduction
CIAO came from a mixture of frustration, need and opportunity from a group of technologists (the authors) working in the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) in the UK.

Frustration at how difficult it was to implement integration between ICT systems in the health and care sector.

Need to be able to do this quickly and cheaply to meet the growing challenges of the economic, efficient and effect delivery of health and care services.

Need to test, through implementation, the many integration specifications and standards the HSCIC create (in the words of Microsoft to “eat our own dog food”). 

Opportunity of the emergence of containerisation and microservices within the IT industry to design bigger and better integration solutions.

Opportunity of resources made available through winning an internal innovation competition within the HSCIC. 

Within England the NHS national strategy for patient centric care necessitates the need to connect and share care information between multiple care providers. These care providers use a variety of ICT systems to record and manage direct patient care. This gives a landscape of distributed, autonomous and multi-standard care ICT systems.

Standards are often posited as the “silver bullet” that moves you from integration to interoperability, if everyone uses the same standards then systems should just plug and play. In real life high level standards around the structure and meaning of care information are still underdeveloped, duplicated and sparsely used. Therefore pragmatically, for the foreseeable future, there is a need for system integration middleware technology to “connect any” ICT systems within health economies.

Middleware technology provides the familiar functions of routing, transformation and orchestration (work flow) of interactions and their content between disparate external ICT systems. There are many commercial and open source middleware products and frameworks available. Products usually provide a comprehensive service through including bundled design, management and monitoring tools. Frameworks just provide a codebase that allows you to build your own integration solution.
  
There are cost, learning time and skill barriers to using both commercial and open source middleware products and frameworks. CIAO aims to reduce these barriers while still maintaining flexibility and adaptability. To be more specific CIAO aims to accelerate integration by:

•	Packaging integration components as microservices (CIPs)
•	Making these CIPs easy to install, configure and manage
•	Providing a set of common CIPs out of the box
•	Providing a development kit to allow the building of new CIPs

Commoditise by:

•	Provide CIPs as free open source software
•	Developing a community of support for the use and development of CIPs
•	Ensuring enterprise class resilience and scalability of CIPs
•	Giving SME opportunities to offer CIAO run, support and development services

Evolve by:

•	Moving from integration technology to integration patterns
•	Moving from static to dynamic integration behaviours
•	Building, seeding and curating a health and care integration ecology
