# User Story Overview

As the CIAO project is working with an Agile methodology it has recorded user needs as a set of epic user stories. An epic user story is a high level, coarse-grained description of a user's functional requirements.

This document catalogues user stories generated during the Discovery phase workshops held as part of the CIAO project.
