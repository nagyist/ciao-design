Talk about the key design principles that should be used when designing a new CIP
and how to apply them at the code level, also any patterns or conventions. Also
talk about initially assessing if a candidate CIP needs disaggregating into separate
independent CIPs. Illustrate with our exemplar CIP (:-) suggest we use this as a
single example that is carried through the rest of the text).
